    <h2>Password changed</h2>
    <p>Dear {{ fname }},</p>
    <p>This is a notification to alert you that, upon your request, your account password has been changed successfully.</p>
    <p>If this was not you, please contact the system administrator immediately to reset your password to maintain account security.</p>
    <p>A gentle reminder to keep passwords in a safe place, and to not share with anyone you may not trust.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Thank you for being a valued user of ArchAIve.</p>
